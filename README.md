# bejeweled-game
Javascript-based version of the Bejeweled videogame.

This videogame was created to apply the learned skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScrip7) during a Programming course at Universitat Jaume I in Spain (fall semester 2023). The handlers' code is written in pure JavaScript language and the styling follows a "from scratch" format in CSS.
